# FETtester
Board to attach to an Arduino to characterize transistors.

Allows adjusting drain (collector) and gate (base) voltage and reading:
gate-source (base-emitter) voltage, 
drain-source (collector-emitter) voltage,
gate (base) current,
drain (collector) current,
and temperature.


Values are level shifted by op amp circuits and measured on the Arduino ADCs.
